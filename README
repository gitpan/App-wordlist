    *   arg => *array*

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   max_len => *int*

    *   min_len => *int*

    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)

TODO
    In -l --detail, show summary (extract from POD Name or # ABSTRACT).

    Option --random (plus -n) to generate (or n) random word(s).

    Option -v (--invert-match) like grep.

    Implement -n (max result).
