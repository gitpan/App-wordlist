=head1 NAME

wordlist - Grep words from Games::Word::{Wordlist,Phraselist}::*

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.01 of wordlist (from Perl distribution App-wordlist), released on 2014-12-04.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

By default print all words from all wordlists:

 % wordlist

 % wordlist

Print all words matching /foo/ or /bar/:

 % wordlist

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=over

=item B<--action>=I<s>

Default value:

 "grep"

Valid values:

 ["list_cpan", "list_installed", "install", "uninstall", "grep"]

=item B<--arg-json>=I<s>

See C<--arg>.

=item B<--arg>=I<s@>

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--detail>

Display more information when listing modules.

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Set output format.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Show help message.

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing:

    [1,2,3]

In this case, you can use `--naked-res`.


=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=item B<--no-ignore-case>

=item B<--or>

Use OR logic instead of the default AND.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Show program version.

Select one or more wordlist modules (JSON-encoded).

See C<--wordlist>.

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C wordlist wordlist

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

You can also install L<App::BashCompletionProg> which makes it easy to add completion for Perinci::CmdLine-based scripts. After you install the module and put C<. ~/.bash-complete-prog> (or C<. /etc/bash-complete-prog>), you can just run C<bash-completion-prog> and the C<complete> command will be added to your C<~/.bash-completion-prog>. Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command.

=head2 fish

To activate fish completion for this script, execute:

 begin; set -lx COMP_SHELL fish; set -lx COMP_MODE gen_command; wordlist; end > $HOME/.config/fish/completions/wordlist.fish

Or if you want to install globally, you can instead write the generated script to C</etc/fish/completions/wordlist.fish> or C</usr/share/fish/completions/wordlist.fish>. The exact path might be different on your system. Please check your C<fish_complete_path> variable.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete wordlist 'p/*/`wordlist`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

=head2 zsh

To activate zsh completion for this script, put:

 _wordlist() { read -l; local cl="$REPLY"; read -ln; local cp="$REPLY"; reply=(`COMP_SHELL=zsh COMP_LINE="$cl" COMP_POINT="$cp" wordlist`) }

 compctl -K _wordlist wordlist

in your zsh startup (e.g. C<~/.zshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.
