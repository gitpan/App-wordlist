=head1 NAME

wordlist - Grep words from Games::Word::{Wordlist,Phraselist}::*

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.09 of wordlist (from Perl distribution App-wordlist), released on 2014-12-18.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % wordlist [options] [arg] ...

Examples:

By default print all words from all wordlists:

 % wordlist

Print all words matching /foo/ and /bar/:

 % wordlist foo bar

Print all words matching /foo/ or /bar/:

 % wordlist --or foo bar

Select a specific wordlist (multiple -w allowed):

 % wordlist -w KBBI foo

Filter by regex:

 % wordlist '/fof[aeiou]/'

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=over

=item B<--action>=I<s>

Default value:

 "grep"

Valid values:

 ["list_cpan", "list_installed", "install", "uninstall", "grep"]

=item B<--arg-json>=I<s>

See C<--arg>.

=item B<--arg>=I<s@>

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--detail>

Display more information when listing modules.

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Set output format.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Show help message.

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--len>=I<i>

=item B<--max-len>=I<i>

=item B<--min-len>=I<i>

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing:

    [1,2,3]

In this case, you can use `--naked-res`.


=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=item B<--no-ignore-case>

=item B<--or>

Use OR logic instead of the default AND.

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C wordlist wordlist

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells. Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time, so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete wordlist 'p/*/`wordlist`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.
